"""Find and Replace
In this string: words = "It's thanksgiving day. It's my birthday,too!" print the position of the first instance of the word "day". Then create a new string where the word "day" is replaced with the word "month".

Min and Max
Print the min and max values in a list like this one: x = [2,54,-2,7,12,98]. Your code should work for any list.
''' Write a program that, given some value, tests that value for its type. Here's what you should do for each type:
Integer: If the integer is greater than or equal to 100, print "That's a big number!" If the integer is less than 100, print "That's a small number"
String: If the string is greater than or equal to 50 characters print "Long sentence." If the string is shorter than 50 characters print "Short sentence."
List: If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 10 print "Big list!" If the list has fewer than 10 values print "Short list." '''
